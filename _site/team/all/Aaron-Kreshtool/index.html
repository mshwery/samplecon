<p>I am a huge Baltimore Orioles, Ravens, &amp; University of Maryland sports fan.</p>

<p>My favorite food group is the P&#8217;s (pizza, pineapple, pesto, chicken parmigiana, et al.) I find peas themselves just OK.</p>

<p>Once, after honking my car horn at another driver, the horn didn&#8217;t turn off. The horn blared continuously the entire 5 mile ride home.</p>
