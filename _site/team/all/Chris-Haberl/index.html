<p>My parents coerced me to play lead clarinet in a traditional marching band for six years - once, when marching towards a funeral, I marched left when everyone else went right.</p>

<p>When riding my bike in my black poncho through Brussels, some guys started singing: &#8220;na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na Batman, Batman, Batman&#8221;.</p>

<p>I am the voice behind the Fulcrum Dragon.</p>
