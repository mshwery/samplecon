<p>I babysat Salma Hayekâ€™s daughter Valentina on a movie set once when I was an extra.</p>

<p>I assisted on a surgery at the Audubon Zoo where we neutered one of the Jaguars.</p>

<p>I have technically died twice. My heart stopped when in was in the Hospital for pneumonia and I had to be shocked back.</p>
