<p>I eat Vietnamese food at least 4 times a week. Pho real.</p>

<p>I have a cat named Phi which is unrelated to my love of Vietnamese food, but has a direct correlation to the Phi Phi islands (in Thailand).</p>

<p>I’m a neat freak and if you don’t watch out you’ll find your belongings stacked in orderly, unrecognizable piles.</p>
