I once met Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky in the same night.

In college I broadcasted multiple NCAA tournament basketball games for my college’s radio station.

For my high school AP US History class I learned every word of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start The Fire” (and still remember them all today).
