I experienced a concussion and temporary memory loss once when a parked car hit me riding my bike.

I have served coffee to more famous people than you can count on three fingers. (Adrien Brody, Abigail Breslin, Rose McGowan, Andrew Bird... that's it.)

Before managing a coffee shop for four years, I had never tried coffee.
