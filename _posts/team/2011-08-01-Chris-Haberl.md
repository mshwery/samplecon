My parents coerced me to play lead clarinet in a traditional marching band for six years - once, when marching towards a funeral, I marched left when everyone else went right.

When riding my bike in my black poncho through Brussels, some guys started singing: "na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na Batman, Batman, Batman".

I am the voice behind the Fulcrum Dragon.
