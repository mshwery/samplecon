I am a huge Baltimore Orioles, Ravens, & University of Maryland sports fan.  

My favorite food group is the P's (pizza, pineapple, pesto, chicken parmigiana, et al.) I find peas themselves just OK.

Once, after honking my car horn at another driver, the horn didn't turn off.  The horn blared continuously the entire 5 mile ride home.
