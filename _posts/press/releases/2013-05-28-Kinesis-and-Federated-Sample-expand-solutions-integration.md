AUSTIN, TX (May 28, 2013) - Kinesis Survey Technologies LLC (Kinesis), the industry leader for future-proof market research software solutions, announces a comprehensive integration to Federated Sample’s Fulcrum platform, enabling monetization of panel assets while retaining control over their use. The integration provides fielding and revenue channels that are not available on this scale via any other offerings within the industry today. 

Kinesis Panel is the premier software solution for managing online research panels and executing panel research studies. Fulcrum is the leading sample management platform and white-label routing solution that automates the sample delivery process. The integration provides many new capabilities within Kinesis Panel- :

- Sample optimization, for routing panelists to other projects for efficiency and improved retention- 
- Generation of new revenue streams by selling sample assets via Fulcrum
- Centralized reporting and analysis of panel and project performance when launching projects and selling assets within Fulcrum

“The integrated Kinesis Panel and Fulcrum platforms provide complete control over how panel assets are utilized, and offer new and potentially highly lucrative revenue channels via the sale of unused sample," said Leslie Townsend, CEO of Kinesis.

“Panel owners can control precisely which panel assets will be used, how often, by whom, and under the specific business rules that they wish to dictate. When used with Fulcrum, Kinesis Panel provides state-of-the-art, powerful panel management capabilities with the largest international, industry-wide exchange.”

Kinesis and Federated Sample initiated a strategic partnership last year with the primary goals of increasing automation in all aspects of online research data collection, as well as providing additional panel monetization options for the market research industry. Kinesis Panel “reads” quotas and other qualification criteria in Fulcrum and automatically builds targeted sample for available projects, while supporting multilingual, multinational projects. Incentive management is fully automated and managed under the rewards plan(s) implemented by the panel.

President of Federated Sample, Michael McCrary, said, 

“Our partnership with Kinesis allows numerous panel owners to optimize their assets and tap into previously non-realized revenue streams. We are thrilled to continue our work with Kinesis to automate and streamline online sampling.”
